# Isthmus take home assignment

Building under constraints, both of time and resources, is a reality of working in a startup. In this exercise, we’d like to understand your process to build an app from scratch, as well as how you choose to focus during a limited amount of time.

In this exercise, we’d like you to build out an application based on the specs below. We’d like you to time box this exercise to no more than 4 hours with the goal being to better understand your thinking and approach to spinning up a new application under a time constraint.

## Specs

We’d like you to demonstrate both your backend and front end knowledge by building a products inventory app.

The goal of this work is to see how you think via code and how you’d prioritize under a time constraint. Feel free to make whatever technical design decisions you need to make progress in this short amount of time.

Code quality and project decisions about components, classes and tools used will be evaluated.
